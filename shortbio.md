<h2>A more official short bio</h2>

Fernando Castor is, since September 2023, an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science of the University of Twente. He has been the principal investigator of 6 research projects funded by Brazilian research agencies. Fernando has supervised more than 25 MSc and PhD students.

His research activity is mainly located within the areas of Software Engineering and Programming Languages ​​and seeks to identify efficient ways to develop software that behaves efficiently. Over the past five years, his research has focused on the energy efficiency of software systems, in particular, on how exploiting the design diversity of preexisting software components can be an inexpensive way to save energy. Furthermore, he has also been investigating how constructs for concurrency control and parallel execution management impact attributes such as performance, energy efficiency, and ease of maintenance. His research is in part experimental and in part based on the analysis of large scale open source code repositories. 

The developments achieved as a result of his research activity have been described in more than 100 scientific publications in some of the best conferences and journals in the aforementioned  scientific areas. Examples include the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering, ACM Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications, International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, and Communications of the ACM. His publications appear to have had non-negligible impact, as evidenced by the more than 3,300 citations they have received (Google Scholar: [goo.gl/7PVWzB](https://goo.gl/7PVWzB)).
