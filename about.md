![Fernando Castor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fernandocastor/fernandocastor.github.io/master/images/eu5.JPG "My pic") 

I am an assistant professor at the [Informatics Center (CIn)](http://www.cin.ufpe.br) of the [Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE)](http://www.ufpe.br), in sunny [Recife](http://www2.recife.pe.gov.br/), [Brazil](http://www.brasil.gov.br). This blog is an attempt to give a coherent and cohesive shape to some disorganized thoughts that sometimes cross my mind. It's focus is on Software Engineering and Programming languages, my main areas of [research](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor/publications), though it's not an exclusively research-centric blog. My [homepage](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor/) provides additional information about me.
