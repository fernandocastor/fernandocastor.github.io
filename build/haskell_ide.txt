- Suggestion of variable and method names (the current culture of using ludicrous names sucks)

- Tooltips to suggest what a given lambda may be (otherwise, it is very tough to understand program behavior without 
global knowledge -- this is a modularity problem)

- Suggestions of types to use in cases where inference is not possible

- Symbolic debugger

- Information about the potential current monads

- Warnings about incomplete patterns (this is impossible, but suggestions would be nice)

- Real deadlock exceptions for MVars
