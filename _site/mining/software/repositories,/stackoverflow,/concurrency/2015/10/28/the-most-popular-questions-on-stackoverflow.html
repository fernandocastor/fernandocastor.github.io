  <article class="post-content">
    <p>We have conducted a study on the most popular questions about concurrent programming on <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>. Our goal with this study was to understand the practical problems faced by software developers when using concurrent programming abstractions. These are the 10 most popular questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/588866/">Q588866</a> “What’s the difference between the atomic and nonatomic attributes?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/541487/">Q541487</a> “‘implements Runnable’ vs. ‘extends Thread’”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6319146/">Q6319146</a> “C++11 introduced a standardized memory model. What does it mean? And how is it going to affect C++ programming?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/200469/">Q200469</a> “What is the difference between a process and a thread”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/661561/">Q661561</a> “How to update the GUI from another thread in C#?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/">Q1036754</a> “Difference between wait() and sleep()”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/62814/">Q62814</a> “Difference between binary semaphore and mutex”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/817856/">Q817856</a> “When and how should I use a ThreadLocal variable?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/510632/">Q510632</a> “What’s the difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Collections.synchronizedMap(Map)?”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/323972/">Q323972</a> “Is there any way to kill a Thread in Python?”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Among the top 10, we have questions specific to Objective-C (1), Java (2,6,9), C++ (3), C# (5), and Python (10). There are also a couple of questions asking about general concepts (3,7) and one that may be thought of as language specific or not (8). </p>

<h2 id="what-are-concurrency-related-questions">What are concurrency-related questions?</h2>
<p>We used the same keywords as the well-known <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1346323">study</a> by Shan Lu and colleagues to select the questions based on the tags associated to them: “race(s)”, “deadlock(s)”, “livelock(s)”, “concurrency”, “lock(s)”, “mutex(es)”, “atomic”, “compete(s)”, and “multithreading”.</p>

<p>This produced a list with more than 22000 questions. We then ranked them by popularity, extracted only the 250 most popular, and manually inspected those to ascertain that they were actually concurrency-related. We ended up with 231 questions.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-we-measure-popularity">How did we measure popularity?</h2>
<p>To calculate the popularity of each question, we obtained, for each one: (i) number of up-votes; (ii) number of times the question is marked as favorite; (iii) number of views; (iv) number of comments; and (v) and number of answers. Each of these metrics was then normalized with respect to the average value considering all the questions in StackOverflow. The <strong>P</strong> popularity measure is the result of calculating the geometric mean of these normalized metrics.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Most of the questions pertained to either Java (77) or C# (60). Also, 28 pertained to mobile computing, focusing on one of the most popular platforms: iOS (6), Android (7), and Windows Phone (15).</p>

<p>We classified the questions in terms of 7 categories:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>Theoretical Concepts (59)
    <ul>
      <li>Q34510 “What is a race condition?”</li>
      <li>Q588866 “What’s the difference between the atomic and nonatomic attributes?”</li>
      <li>Q200469 “What is the difference between a process and a thread?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Practical Concepts  (51)
    <ul>
      <li>Q817856 “When and how should I use a ThreadLocal variable?”</li>
      <li>Q154551 “Which [synchronization] approach should be used [to increment an int]?”</li>
      <li>Q251391 “Why is lock(this) {. . . } bad?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First Steps (29)
    <ul>
      <li>Q2846653 “Trying to find a simple example that clearly shows a single task being divided for multi-threading.”</li>
      <li>Q3360555 “How to pass parameters to ThreadStart method in Thread?”</li>
      <li>Q2734025 “Is javascript guaranteed to be single-threaded?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thread Life-Cycle (18)
    <ul>
      <li>Q1520887 “How to pause / sleep thread or process in Android?”</li>
      <li>Q323972 “Is there any way to kill a Thread in Python?”</li>
      <li>Q289434 “How to make a Java thread wait for another thread’s output?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Technical Problems (53)
    <ul>
      <li>Q661561 “How to update the GUI from another thread in C#?”</li>
      <li>Q530211 “[How to] create a blocking Queue<t> in .NET?"</t></li>
      <li>Q16159203 “Why does this Java program terminate despite that apparently it shouldn’t (and didn’t)?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Concurrent Lib/Framework (15 Q)
    <ul>
      <li>Q3629784 “How is Node.js inherently faster when it still relies on Threads internally?”</li>
      <li>Q6916385 “Is there a concurrent List in Java’s JDK?”</li>
      <li>Q3847108 “What is the Haskell response to Node.js?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Correctness (10 Q)
    <ul>
      <li>Q9666 “Is accessing a variable in C# an atomic operation?”</li>
      <li>Q7095 “Is the C# constructor thread safe?”</li>
      <li>Q680097 “I’ve heard i++ isn’t thread safe, is ++i thread-safe?”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Among all the questions, only one pertained to GPUs and not a single one asked specifically about improving performance, which is surprising. I could say that we learned three main things from this study: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Developers do not understand the problems that existing tools report about concurrency errors, because they often do not understand the errors themselves. Error reports that provide actual code examples have a stronger potential to be useful (see the third point below)</li>
  <li>Tools that help developers to build the software right, instead of trying to right the system after it’s built are useful. For example, a simple tool that indicates to developers which parts of the code execute atomically is straightforward to build and could be easily integrated into existing IDEs</li>
  <li>Developers want examples, both minimal examples of things that work correctly and minimal examples of code that help them understand concurrency problems. </li>
</ul>
