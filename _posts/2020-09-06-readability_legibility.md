This is about our paper.

Why do we need different terms? 

Why do we need to name things? What do we gain? Design patterns. What else?

Legibility and readability tweak very different code features.Legibility is about making words visible in an identifier, indentation, horizontal and vertical spacing. Readability has a much wider range of options, since there are also syntactic and semantic aspects involved. 


Just code, no tools. Tools can enhance both readability and legibility.


Text extracted from it.

In software engineering, the terms readability, legibility, un- derstandability, and comprehensibility have overlapping mean- ings. For example, Buse and Weimer [21] define “readability as a human judgment of how easy a text is to understand”. In a similar vein, Almeida et al. [22] affirm that “legibility is fundamental to code maintenance; if source code is written in a complex way, understanding it will require much more effort”. In addition, Lin and Wu [23] state that ““Software understandability” determines whether a system can be un- derstood by other individuals easily, or whether artifacts of one system can be easily understood by other individuals”. Xia et al. [24] treat comprehension and understanding as synonyms, expressing that “Program comprehension (aka., program understanding, or source code comprehension) is a process where developers actively acquire knowledge about a software system by exploring and searching software artifacts, and reading relevant source code and/or documentation”.

In linguistics the concept of text comprehension is similar to program comprehension in software engineering. Gough and Tunmer [25] state that “comprehension (not reading compre- hension, but rather linguistic comprehension) is the process by which given lexical (i.e., word) information, sentences and discourses are interpreted”. However, Hoover and Gough [26] further elaborate on that definition and claim that “decoding and linguistic comprehension are separate components of reading skill”. This claim highlights the existence of two separate processes during text comprehension: (i) decoding the words/symbols and (ii) interpreting them and sentences formed by them. DuBay [27] separates these two processes and defines them as legibility, which concerns typeface, layout, and other aspects related to the identification of elements in text, and readability, that is, what makes some texts easier to read than others. In a similar vein, for Tekif [28], legibility studies are mainly concerned with typographic and layout factors while readability studies concentrate on the linguistic factors.

These two perspectives also apply to programs. We can find both the visual characteristics and linguistic factors in source code, although with inconsistent terminology. For example,
Daka et al. [29] affirm that “the visual appearance of code in general is referred to as its readability”. The authors clearly refer to legibility (in the design/linguistics sense) but employ the term “readability” possibly because it is more often used in the software engineering literature.

Based on the differences between the terms “readability” and “legibility” that are well-established in other areas such as linguistics [27], design [30], human-computer interaction [31], and education [28], we believe that the two terms should have clear, distinct, albeit related, meanings also in the area of soft- ware engineering. On the one hand, the structural and semantic characteristics of the source code of a program that affect the ability of developers to understand it while reading the code, e.g., programming constructs, coding idioms, and meaningful identifiers, impact its readability. On the other hand, the visual characteristics of the source code of a program, which affect the ability of developers to identify the elements of the code while reading it, such as line breaks, spacing, alignment, indentation, blank lines, identifier capitalization, impact its legibility. Hereafter, we employ these two terms according to these informal definitions.
