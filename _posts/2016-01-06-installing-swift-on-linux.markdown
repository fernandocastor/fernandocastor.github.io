Today I installed Swift on Linux. It was much more straightforward than I'd assumed it would be. The Ray Wenderlich [webiste](http://www.raywenderlich.com/) has a nice [tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/122189/introduction-to-open-source-swift-on-linux) on how to do that and, considering that high level of the tutorials on that website, I can safely assume it is good. Nevertheless, this tutorial assumes that one does not have Linux installed. Therefore, it is a bit overlong and not very interesting for me, since I'm running Linux Mint natively. The [Swift.org](http://www.swift.org) website also includes step-by-step [instructions](https://swift.org/download/#linux) on how to install Swift. The emphasis, in this case, is on contributors who will be sending pull requests or contributing directly to the Swift distribution. Therefore, it spends quite some space talking about PGP keys. Again, not quite my thing. 

The place where I found the definite set of instructions was Swift's [README.MD](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/README.md) file. Since there may be other lazy developers out there who want to install Swift on Linux, I summarize below the set of steps I followed:
