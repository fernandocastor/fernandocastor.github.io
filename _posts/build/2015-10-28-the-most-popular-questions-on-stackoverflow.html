<p>We (mainly <a href='http://www.gustavopinto.org'>Gustavo Pinto</a>, with a little help from <a href='https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor/'>myself</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/weslleytorres'>Weslley Torres</a>) have conducted a study on the most popular questions about concurrent programming on <a href='http://www.stackoverflow.com'>StackOverflow</a>. Our goal with this study was to understand the practical problems faced by software developers when using concurrent programming abstractions. These are the 10 most popular questions:</p>

</ol>

<p>Among the top 10, we have questions specific to Objective-C (1), Java (2,6,9), C++ (3), C# (5), and Python (10). There are also a couple of questions asking about general concepts (3,7) and one that may be thought of as language specific or not (8).</p>

<h2 id='what_are_concurrencyrelated_questions'>What are concurrency-related questions?</h2>

<p>We used the same keywords as the well-known <a href='http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1346323'>study</a> by Shan Lu and colleagues to select the questions based on the tags associated to them: &#8220;race(s)&#8221;, &#8220;deadlock(s)&#8221;, &#8220;livelock(s)&#8221;, &#8220;concurrency&#8221;, &#8220;lock(s)&#8221;, &#8220;mutex(es)&#8221;, &#8220;atomic&#8221;, &#8220;compete(s)&#8221;, and &#8220;multithreading&#8221;.</p>

<p>This produced a list with more than 22000 questions. We then ranked them by popularity, extracted only the 250 most popular, and manually inspected those to ascertain that they were actually concurrency-related. We ended up with 231 questions.</p>

<h2 id='how_did_we_measure_popularity'>How did we measure popularity?</h2>

<p>To calculate the popularity of each question, we obtained, for each one: (i) number of up-votes; (ii) number of times the question is marked as favorite; (iii) number of views; (iv) number of comments; and (v) and number of answers. Each of these metrics was then normalized with respect to the average value considering all the questions in StackOverflow. The <strong>P</strong> popularity measure is the result of calculating the geometric mean of these normalized metrics.</p>

<h2 id='summary'>Summary</h2>

<p>Most of the questions pertained to either Java (77) or C# (60). Also, 28 pertained to mobile computing, focusing on one of the most popular platforms: iOS (6), Android (7), and Windows Phone (15).</p>

<li>Q680097 &#8220;I’ve heard i++ isn’t thread safe, is ++i thread-safe?&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Among all the questions, only one pertained to GPUs and not a single one asked specifically about improving performance, which is surprising. I could say that we learned three main things from this study:</p>

<ul>
<li>Developers do not understand the problems that existing tools report about concurrency errors, because they often do not understand the errors themselves. Error reports that provide actual code examples have a stronger potential to be useful (see the third point below)</li>

<li>Tools that help developers to build the software right, instead of trying to right the system after it&#8217;s built are useful. For example, a simple tool that indicates to developers which parts of the code execute atomically is straightforward to build and could be easily integrated into existing IDEs</li>

<li>Developers want examples, both minimal examples of things that work correctly and minimal examples of code that help them understand concurrency problems.</li>
</ul>
